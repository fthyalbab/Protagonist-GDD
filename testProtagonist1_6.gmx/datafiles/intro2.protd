H: "Welcome Hero, to darkness of war. You made a new game and you're back for more."

H: "Normally I'd say you together band, and strike down those who force thy hand."

H: "Except as you've already read, the mortals are already dead."

H: "So go ahead, sit back, while I narrate. Opening lines are little more than bait."

H: "Don't mind if I make things go a bit faster. I'm bored to death by this tale of disaster."

H: "And it all ended happily, ever, after."

H: "Bye."

P: "Wait!"

H: "Yes?"

P: "I'm here to play the game now."

H: "So I see. I regret to inform you that the game is very much over."

P: "If the world is destroyed, then where are we now?"

H: "The world isn't destroyed. We just got rid of the mortals. It's perfectly nice here now."

H: "But to answer your questions, since I'm forced to..."

H: "We're in a very nice box."

P: "Can I leave the box?"

H: "Keep your arms and legs inside the box at all times, please."

H: "And give me that."
